## Reconnaissance/Foot Printing
    Footprinting is the first step in Ethical Hacking

    In this process one should gather maximum information about the target

## Types of Footprinting
### Passive Footprinting
    Gathering information about the target without direct interaction
        * Finding information through Search engines
        * finding sub-domains of a target network
        * Finding Location information
        * People search using social networking sites
        * Information through deep and dark web sites
### Active Footprinting
    Gathering information about the target with direct interaction
        * Querying published name servers
        * Website path fuzzing
        * whois lookup
        * DNS Footprinting
        * Network Footprinting
        * Website mirroring

## Google Dorking
    cache: displays the webpages stored in google cache
    link: lists webpage that have links to the specified webpage
    (all)intitle: Restricts the results to those webpages containing the search keyword in the title
    (all)inurl: restricts the resukts to those conatining the search keyword in the url
    info: Presents some information that google has about a particular web page
    site: Restricts the results to those websites in the given domain

    Google Hacking Database (GHDB): It is a database of queries to identify sensitive data

    Syntax: Operator:search_term
